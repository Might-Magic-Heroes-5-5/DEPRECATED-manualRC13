# Heroes of Might and Magic 5.5 manual
Open source manual for the Heroes of might and magic 5.5 mod (http://www.moddb.com/mods/might-magic-heroes-55).
Written on Ruby using shoes 3 (http://walkabout.mvmanila.com)

Manual can be downloaded from here -> http://www.moddb.com/mods/might-magic-heroes-55/downloads/mmh55-reference-manual

Folder distribution is respectfully:
text - all text descriptions
pics - images used in the manual
design - This is where the code gets the file structure architecture
code - some auxiliary code (currently only the Popup functionality is there)
docs - documentation on the data samples which are not homogenous or has been adjusted from the source in the sake of keeping the manual homogenous data structure.
